Rendering a 3D scene consists of presenting the user with a series of still images in rapid succession.
This is generally done using a render loop.
A very basic render loop can be implemented as follow:

	while (!quit)
	{		
		// Update the camera transform based on interacive
		// inputs or by following a predefined path (i.e. cinematic)
		undateCamera();

		// Update positions, orientations, and any other
		// relevant visual state of any dynamic elements
		// in the scene
		updateSceneElements();

		// Redner a still frame into an off-screen frame
		// buffer known as the 'back buffer'
		rednerScene();

		// Swap the back buffer wiht the front buffer, making
		// the most recently rendered image visible
		// on-screen. Or, in windowed mode, copy (blit) the
		// back buffer's contents to the front buffer
		swapBuffers();
	}
