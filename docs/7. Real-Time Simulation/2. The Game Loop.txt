A game is comprised of many interacting subsystems, including device I/, rendering, animation, physics, multiplayer networking, audio, etc.
Most subsystems require periodic servicing, however the servicing rate varies form subsystem to subsystem.
Animation typically must be updated in sync with the rendering system (i.e. 30 or 60 Hz), whereas physics usually needs more frequent updates (maybe 120 Hz).
Higher level subsystems like AI sometimes only need to be services once every second, and don't neccessarily need to be synchronised with the rendering loop.


Most engines also support an event system, this allows for different subsystems to express their interest in knowing when different events are triggered so they can respond accordingly.
This system could also be used for updating subsystems by creating update events and allowing the subsystems to respond to these events by updating themselves.
Though the engine must suport event posting (i.e. scheduling an event to happen at a future time) for this to be an option.
