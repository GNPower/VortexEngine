Asynchronous File I/O:
	
	-Implement a asynchronous file I/O library for file streaming
		-Should allow retreival of the file through either a callback function or soft/hard deadline specification
		-Callback function method: provided a function to call, will call it once the resource is loaded, nothing returned from this loading function
		-Deadline Method: provide a soft deadline (in ms) that the file should be loaded by.
				  a file load process will be created and given a process ID (PID), this PID is returned to the caller.
				  The PID can be passed to the load manager to get the current state of the process ('pending', 'loading', or 'complete').
				  once compelte the PID can be passed to the load manager to get the loaded resource.
				  if the game cannot continue without the resource the load manager's 'requireNow()' method can be called with the PID.
				  this will stall then engine until the load is complete and then return the loaded resource.
