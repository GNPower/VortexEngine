Platform Detection:

	-specific platform detection handled by the JVM, can be accessed by calling 
	-Should provide a static class 'Platform' that provides engine with details about the platform it is running on
		-


Atomic Data Types:

	-handled by Java


Collections and Iterators:

	-iterators should be a method implentation in the Collection specific implementation
	-The following collections are not sufficiently present in Java and should be implemented:
		-Linked List
		-Stack
		-Queue
		-Deque
		-Tree
		-Binary Search Tree (BST)
		-Quadtree
		-Binary Heap
		-Priority Queue
		-Graph
		-Directed Acyclic Graph


File System:

	-Implement a 'Path' class who can store a path using engine specific syntax (probly close to linux), and can return OS specific variations of that path	
	-Implement a 'ResourceLoader' class capable of synchronous resource loading of all resource types. This class must be passed an engine specific 'Path'


Network Transport Layer:

	-TBD


Hi-Res Timer:

	-TBD


Threading Library:

	-TBD


Graphics Wrappers:

	-TBD


Physics/Collision Wrappers:

	-Not to be implemented yet
