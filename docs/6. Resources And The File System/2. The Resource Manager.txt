The resource manager is comprised of two distinct but integrated components.
One component manages the offline tools used to create the assets and transform them into their engine-ready form.
The other component manages the resources at runtime, ensuring they are loaded before they are needed in the game, and unloaded after they're used

The Resource Database:

-This database should be capable of processing resources from their outside formats to their engine ready forms.
-It should also provide these basic functionalities:

	-The ability to create new resources
	-The ability to delete resources
	-The ability to inspect and modify existing resources
	-The ability to move one resources files from one location to another
	-The ability of a resource to cross reference other resources
		-This helps drive the resource building process and the loading process by ensuring no duplicate data is used
	-The ability to maintain referential integrity of all its cross references within the database
		-This ability must hold during common operations like deleting or moving resources
	-The ability to maintain a revision history, complete with a log of who made each change and why
	-The ability to search or query the database for desired resources
