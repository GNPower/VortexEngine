Digital Buttons:

	-almost every HID has at least a few digital buttons
	-a digital button are buttons that can only be in two states, pressed or not pressed
	-these states are often reffered to as down (pressed) or up (not pressed)
	-in software the state of a digital button is uaually represented by a single bit
	- '0' usually represents up (not pressed) and '1' to represent down (pressed)
	-it is common for the states of all buttons to be packed into a single unsigned integer

Analog Axes And Buttons:

	-an analog input is one that can take on a range of values (not just 0 or 1)
	-these are usually used to represent the degress to which a trigger is pressed or the location of a joystick
	-most inputs are digitized by the time they reach the engine, meaning they will lie on a range of numbers, say -32,768 to 32,768 for floats
