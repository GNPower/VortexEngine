-all human interface devices provide input to the game engine, and some allow the engine to provide feedbac to the HID
-game engines read and write to these HID's in various ways depending on the specific design of the HID in question

Polling:

	-some simple devices, like oldschool joysticks and game pads, are read by polling the stae of the device periodically

Interrupts:
	
	-Some HID's only send data to the engine when the controller state changes, since theres no use sending repeat data
	-this device usually communicates with the compiuter via hardware interrupts
	-an interrupt is an electronic signal generated by the hardware, which causes the CPU to temporarily suspend execution of
	 the main program to run a small chunk of code called an interrupt service routine (ISR)
	-the ISR will read that state of the device and store it later for processing
	-the engine can now read the data wehenever it is convenient to do so

Wireless Devices:
	
	-a wireless devices state cannot be read by simply checking a hardware register location
	-the computer must communicate with the device via a protocol (Bluetooth for example)
	-this communication protocol is usually either in a seperate thread from the main game loop or wrapped in an easily callable API
	-this makes wireless devices almot indistinguishable from wired from the perspective if the engine
