Multiplayer comes in four basic catagories:

	- Single Screen multiplayer
			
			- multiple HID's allow control of many players, who all share the same camera
			- 'Fireboy and Watergirl' is a good example of this

	- Split Screen Multiplayer

			- multiple characters inhabit the same world, each having seperate cameras
			- the screen is split into section to display all these cameras viewpoints at the same time
			- 'COD 3' local multiplayer functionality is a good example

	- Networked Multiplayer

			- multiple computers or consoles are connected together
			- all players are on different hardware but share the saem in game world

	- MMO Games

			- hundereds of thousands of players can be playing online at once, all within the same world

Consideration for how multiplayer will owrk and be integrated into the game engine should be taken from day 1,
as retrofitting a game engine with multiplayer capabilities can be a very difficult task to do properly
