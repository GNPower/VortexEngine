Should be architected to divorce (separate) low level deatails like controller binary input from the high level details of what each button does

Should allow incoming data to be manipulated to include things like 

	- deadzones
	- debouncing of button input
	- deteting button down and up events seperately
	- customizeable mapping between controller button and what it does
	- should also provide ways to detect chords (multiple button pressed together) and sequences (buttons pressed in sequence within a time limit)
