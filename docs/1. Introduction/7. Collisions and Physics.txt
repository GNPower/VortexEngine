The 'physics system' of a game engine is better described as a rigid body dynamics system. 
It it mostly concerned with the motion of rigid bodies and the forces and moments caused by them.

Havok is the industry standard for realistic physics, but its not free :(
 
Next best option is NVIDIA's PhysX engine, thouh its not open source.
Should look into tutorials on PhysX to see if its docs are good enough to easily use

Popular open source physics engines are also available such as:

	- Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
	- I-Collide
	- V-Collide
	- RAPID
