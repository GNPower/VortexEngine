An iterator is a class that 'knows' how to efficiently visit each element in a particular kind of container.
It acts like an array index or pointer, refering to one element at a time and allowing for it to be advanced to the next.
It should provide some sort of mechanism for determining whether or not all elements have been visited.

Benefits of using an iterator over direct access are as follows:

	-direct access would break class encapsulation
	-an iterator can iterate over the elements of the container effieciently without exposing the implenetation
	-iterators simplify the process of iterating
