Game engines have a large number of configurable options, some which will be exposed to the end user, but some will be kept available only to the developer.
These developer only options may be stripped from the game and changed to hard coded value when shipped.

Examples Of Player Exposed Options:

	-graphics quality settings
	-volume of music and sounds
	-in game options menus


Examples Of Developer Only Options:

	-playeer characters maximum walking speed


Loading and Saving Options:

	Configuable options can be implemented easily using a global variable, or as a member of a singleton class.
	Saving these options to the disk can be done in many different ways

	-Text Configuration Files

		-the most common way to store options
		-allows them to be stored in a formatted, human readable file
		-common format choices are Windows INI, or XML

	-Compressed Binary Files

		-best used when storage space is limited
		-allows for options to be stored in a way not easily readable by humans
		-can be used to store options the developer doesn't necessarily want people being able to read or change directly from the file

	-Windows Registry
	-Command Line Options
	-Environment Variables

	-Online User Profiles

		-can be used to save options as well as other useful data in a place acessible anywhere the user has internet connection
		-data can be stored in a central server, allows for easier tracking of desired metrics


Per-User Options:

	- Many engines differ between global and per-user options
	- Allows the end user to tweak the gaem the their liking, as well as developers or artist during development
	- This tweaking can be done without stepping on each others toes
	- Care must be taken to store per-user options in a way that each user can only see their own
	- In Windows the hidden AppData folder is used to store user specific data in per application folders.


Loading Configuration:

	-On engine startup, configuration can be loaded from many different places.
	-Basic options for how the engine should start up can be loaded from the comand line
	-These basic options cannot be loaded from the command line for the final game however, so choose these arguments carefully
	-Scheme Data Files (or other human readable formats) for all options while in development
	-If wanted some of the human readable files can be transformed into propietary binary formats when shipped

	-These configuration files can be transformed into engine classes or data structures as well, if you want to use more than just variables as options
