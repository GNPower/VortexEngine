Profiler fall into two broad catagories:

	- Statistical Profilers:

			- this kind of profiler is designed to be un-intrusve, so the code runs at almost the same speed as production
			- they work by sampling the CPU program counter periodically to see which function is running
			- they give a general idea of which parts of the code are taking the longest to run
			- Intel's 'VTune' is a good choice for statistical profilers

	- Instrumenting Profilers:

			- this profiler is extermemly intrusive meaning the code will run to almost a halt
			- it is designed to provide the most accurate detail about the programs execution as possible
			- they work by inserting their own code into almost every line, to record excruciating details about the codes execution
			- IBM's 'Rational Quantify' available as part of the 'Rational Purify Plus' suite is a good choice for this
