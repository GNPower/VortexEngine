in depth covrage of 3d math for games is covered in Eric Lengyel's book [28]

Solving 3D Problems in 2D:

	-a good approach  to solving 3d problems is to try and redefine them in 2D
	-this will not always work but is a good place to start to solve a problem

Points And Vectors:

	-the cartesian coordinate system is the most common system in games
	-There are however other systems used in games. a math library should include all three
	 as well as a way to convert between them
			-Cylindrical coordinates (h, r, theta)
			-Spherical coordinate (r, phi, theta)
			

	-game programmers typically work with a left handed coordinate system, where x points right, y up, and z away from the viewer

	-it is sometimes useful to define the unit vectors in the math library for later use in the code
	-math library for vectors should have these basic functionalities
		-scalar multiplication (both uniform and non-uniform scaling)
		-addition and subraction
		-magnitude
		-squared magnitude (because square roots are very expensive to calculate on even modern hardware)
		 **never take a square root when you don't have to**
		-normalization (converting to a unit vector)
		-dot product
		-cross product
		-linear interpolation ( LERP=(A,B,beta) lies beta percent of the way along the line from A to B )
			=[ (1 - beta)*Ax + beta*Bx , (1 - beta)*Ay + beta*By , (1 - beta)*Az + beta*Bz ]



Matrices:

	-math library for matrices should have these basic functionalities
		-matrix multiplication
		-inversion (not all matrices have inverses, but all 'affine' matrices do)
		-transpose
	

Matrix scaling can be done either uniformly or non-uniformly. Though to keep bounding checks of spheres fast, many engines restrict collision primitives to only uniform scaling
Some game libraries also omit the 4th column in a 4x4 matrix, making a 4x3 affine matrix. This is because the 4th column is always [0 0 0 1]^T


View Space:

	-OpenGL defines its view space tro e right handed. The engine should do the same since it is using OpenGL's API


Quaternions:

	-math library for quaternions should have these basic functionalities
		-magnitude
		-multiplication
		-conjugate
		-inverse
		-matrix to quaternion (http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/conversions/matrixToQuaternion/index.htm)
		-linear interpolation
		-spherical linear interpolation
		-

Lines Rays and Line Segments:

	-not sure if should be included in math library
	-should check mathematics for game programming book or variaous game engine math libraries to see if this must be included

Spheres:

	-usually expressed as a center point plus a radius
	-this packs nicely into a Vector4f = [Cx  Cy  Cz  r]
	-packing data into Vector4f (or anyhting with 32-bit floats, i.e. 128-bit packages) is useful for SIMD math

Planes:

	-not sure if should be included in math library
	-should check mathematics for game programming book or variaous game engine math libraries to see if this must be included\

	-can also be stored in a Vector4f [A  B  C  d] where d is the distance from the point to the plane
	-interestingly using a matrix to switch between spaces will also work on this representation of a plane
